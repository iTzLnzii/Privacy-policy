<h2>1. Scope and Acceptance</h2>
<p>
This Privacy Policy describes how information is processed in connection with your use of this mobile game (“the Game”).
By downloading, accessing, or using the Game, you acknowledge that you have read and understood this Privacy Policy.
</p>

<h2>2. Personal Data Collected</h2>
<p>
We do not directly collect personal information such as your name, mailing address, telephone number, or email address through the Game.
</p>
<p>
However, third-party service providers integrated within the Game may automatically collect certain technical and usage data.
</p>

<h2>3. Advertising Services (Google AdMob)</h2>
<p>
The Game uses Google AdMob to display advertisements, including banner, interstitial, and rewarded ads.
AdMob may collect and process the following categories of information:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Advertising identifiers (such as the Android Advertising ID)</li>
<li>IP address (used to determine approximate geographic location)</li>
<li>Device type, operating system, and language settings</li>
<li>Interaction data related to advertisements (impressions, clicks)</li>
<li>Security, fraud prevention, and diagnostic information</li>
</ul>

<p>
Depending on applicable laws, users may be presented with a consent mechanism regarding personalized advertising.
Where consent is required, advertising processing is based on user consent.
Where consent is not required or not granted, non-personalized advertisements may be displayed.
</p>

<p>
Google’s Privacy Policy is available at:
<a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a>
</p>

<h2>4. Legal Basis for Processing (EEA/UK Users)</h2>
<p>
For users located in the European Economic Area (EEA) or the United Kingdom, processing of personal data by third-party advertising providers may be based on:
</p>
<ul>
<li>User consent (for personalized advertising, where applicable)</li>
<li>Legitimate interests (for security, fraud prevention, and service operation)</li>
<li>Compliance with legal obligations</li>
</ul>

<h2>5. International Data Transfers</h2>
<p>
Information processed by third-party providers such as Google may be transferred to and processed on servers located outside your country of residence,
including in jurisdictions that may not provide the same level of data protection as your home country.
Such transfers are conducted in accordance with applicable legal safeguards.
</p>

<h2>6. In-App Purchases</h2>
<p>
The Game offers optional in-app purchases processed exclusively by the relevant platform provider (such as Google Play).
We do not receive, process, or store payment card details or billing information.
</p>

<h2>7. Data Retention</h2>
<p>
We do not maintain independent servers for storing user personal data.
Any data processed by third-party service providers is retained according to their respective privacy policies and applicable laws.
</p>

<h2>8. Children and General Audience</h2>
<p>
The Game is not directed specifically toward children, but it is intended for a general audience.
We do not knowingly collect personal information directly from children.
If you believe that a minor has provided personal information directly to us,
please contact us at the email address listed above.
</p>

<h2>9. User Rights</h2>
<p>
Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have rights regarding personal data processed by third-party providers,
including the right to access, correct, delete, restrict, or object to certain data processing activities.
</p>

<h3>California Residents (CCPA/CPRA)</h3>
<p>
We do not sell personal information directly.
Advertising-related data processing is conducted by third-party providers.
California residents may request information about data practices or request deletion where applicable.
</p>

<h2>10. Advertising Identifier Controls</h2>
<p>
Users may reset or limit the use of their Advertising ID through device settings.
On Android devices, this can typically be managed through system privacy or ads settings.
</p>

<h2>11. Security</h2>
<p>
We implement reasonable measures to ensure secure integration of third-party services.
However, no electronic transmission or storage system can be guaranteed to be completely secure.
</p>

<h2>12. Third-Party Responsibility</h2>
<p>
This Privacy Policy applies solely to the Game.
We are not responsible for the privacy practices of third-party services,
including advertising networks or external websites that may be accessed through advertisements.
</p>

<h2>13. Changes to This Policy</h2>
<p>
We reserve the right to update this Privacy Policy at any time.
Any changes will be reflected by updating the “Last Updated” date above.
Continued use of the Game after such changes constitutes acceptance of the revised Policy.
